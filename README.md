# AIUK Data Study Group challenge

Welcome to the demonstration documentation for the AIUK Data Study Group challenge. This set of documents will allow you to get started with the datasets we plan to use during the challenge, see some examples of how we have explored the data, and read about some open questions you might like to explore.

The main document is the Jupyter Notebook [aiuk.ipynb](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/DSGaiuk2022/blob/main/aiuk.ipynb). Follow the instructions below to run the examples on either Google Colab or your own system. Don't worry if you haven't used Jupyter before, clicking through will show you a completed version so you can read through the information at your own pace.

We suggest that during the challenge, you delegate someone who is familiar with data science tools and the Jupyter environment to share their screen with other members of their group. However, we do encourage everyone to at least read through and try to follow the examples before the event.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The questions we've explored while developing the notebook are simple examples of how we could use the data, but you should think about what questions you might like to answer during the challenge. We've added some examples of potential questions at the end of the notebook, but feel free to develop your own analysis.

What we'd like you to end up with after the challenge, along with the experience of collaborating with other data scientists in self-guided study, is a short set of ideas for discussion; something you can present in around 5-6 minutes, with 1-2 slides illustrating your most interesting finding. We've added some sample PowerPoint templates to this repository, but please use what you're most comfortable with.

## Running on Google Colab

1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com
2. Click "include private repos".
3. Under the "GitHub" tab, type the URL of this repo (https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/DSGaiuk2022/), then click on "aiuk.ipynb"
4. Open [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1adprVKMxSlXTn-S3ZAbOx545cxv5CzHl?usp=sharing) and connect to your Google Drive account
5. Then go to "Shared with me" in your Google Drive, right-click the "AIUK" folder and select "Add shortcut to Drive"

Note: if you don't have a Google account, you can still run the notebook in Colab. You just need to set `colab = False`, and the data will be downloaded to Colab, but you can't access it outside of the environment and it will be deleted after you close the notebook.

## Running the notebook on your own computer

1. Clone this repo
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter
3. Set `colab = False`
